This code loads data from a CSV file containing information about professional connections, including the company name, position, and number of connections for each connection. It then maps categorical variables (company and position) to numerical codes using the Pandas factorize function. The data is then plotted as a 3D scatter plot using Matplotlib, with the company and position codes on the x and y axes, respectively, and the number of connections on the z axis. The color of each point is determined by a color map, and tick labels are added to the x and y axes using the original categorical variable labels. The tick spacing is adjusted to improve readability, and the plot is displayed using the plt.show() function.
